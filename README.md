## How it works

### Trigger

Actions will trigger when a Pull Request is completed and merged.

### Extraction of branches

The action takes the names of the branch to sync with you commit message of your Pull Request, for do that your commit message must have the next sentence:

**<namebranch1&namebranch2>**

![merge title](./docs/img/merge_image.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended that the sentence is at the end of the commit message.

When the Pull Request is accepted, the action will be executed

**namebranch1**: The name of the first branch to sync.

**namebranch2**: The name of the seconds branch to sync.

> [!TIP]
> If you want a sync just one branch, your sentence must be: \<namebranch1>

### Notes

- When the Pull Request has complete and merge to the target branch, this action realize a merge between that target branch an the branches selected in the commit message of the Pull Request.
- The auto generate Pull Request has a tag called "automated-pr".

## Limitations

1. Sync branch action only works with max two branches to sync at the same time.
2. This actions only be executed when a Pull Request is completed.

## Exclude files

If you want to exclude files in your branch to be sync, you can create a txt file that contains those files, for example:

![exclude_file](./docs/img/exclude_files.png)

This file can selected in the ours_files_list input
