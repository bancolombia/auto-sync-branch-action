## How it works

### Trigger

Actions will trigger when a Pull Request is completed and merged.

### Extraction of branches

The action takes the names of the branch to sync with you commit message of your Pull Request, for do that your commit message must have the next sentence:

**<namebranch1&namebranch2>**

![merge title](./docs/img/merge_image.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sentence must be in the last part of the commit message.

When the Pull Request is accepted, the action will be executed

**namebranch1**: The name of the first branch to sync.

**namebranch2**: The name of the seconds branch to sync.

> If you want a sync just one branch, your sentence must be: \<namebranch1>

### Notes

When the Pull Request has complete and merge to the target branch, this action realize a merge between that target branch an the branches selected in the commit message of the Pull Request.

## Limitations

Sync branch action only works with max two branches to sync at the same time.

## Exclude files

If you want to exclude files in your branch to be sync, you can create a txt file that contains those files, for example:

![exclude_file](./docs/img/exclude_files.png)
